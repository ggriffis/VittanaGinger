Thank you for allowing me the opportunity to work on this coding challenge!
===========================================================================

I wrote the solution in Ruby.  In order to run it, you will need to have Ruby installed.

Question 1) Run "ruby case_it.rb" from the VittanaGinger app directory--then my program will ask for either an input filename or direct input.  I have not added any error handling for faulty input at this time but could add that if you would like me to.  For the sake of the exercise, I am assuming that the input will be valid--a comma delimited list of names.

Question 2) Run "ruby sum_threes_up_to_1000.rb" from the VittanaGinger app directory.  This will call a method that will find the sum of all multiples of 3 under 1000.  The method takes 2 parameters, the multiple and the max, so it could be used to find the multiples of any number under any max number.

I wrote the automated tests for both problems in minitest.  In order to run them all, you would run "rake" from the VittanaGinger app directory.
