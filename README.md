Thank you for allowing me the opportunity to work on this coding challenge!
===========================================================================

I wrote the solution in Ruby.  In order to run it, you will need to have Ruby installed and run "ruby case_it.rb" from the VittanaGinger app directory--then my program will ask for either an input filename or direct input.  

I wrote the automated tests in minitest.  In order to run them, you would run "rake" from the VittanaGinger app directory.

I have not added any error handling for faulty input at this time but could add that if you would like me to.  For the sake of the exercise, I am assuming that the input will be valid--a comma delimited list of names.
